# 1. STAFFING PHILOSOPHY & STRATEGY

## 1.1 THE "PARTY COMPOSITION" MODEL

Questpoint Cafe does not hire for a single "ideal candidate." We build **balanced teams** where different members bring different strengths. Like a well-built RPG party, we need variety.

**The Mistake to Avoid:**
Searching exclusively for "Barista Gamers"—people who are simultaneously:
- Excellent at hospitality and beverage preparation
- Deeply knowledgeable about Magic: The Gathering, board games, and gaming culture
- Available for cafe shift work
- In your geographic area

This unicorn exists, but not in sufficient numbers to staff an operation. Waiting for unicorns means understaffing, burnout, and compromised service.

**The Solution:**
Build teams where **gaming competency is distributed across shifts**, not required at maximum intensity from every individual. Every shift must have the collective capability to:
- Make excellent beverages
- Provide warm customer service
- Answer basic gaming questions
- Run scheduled events
- Handle equipment rentals

No single person needs to excel at ALL of these. The TEAM does.

## 1.2 THE SHIFT COVERAGE MATRIX

Every shift requires certain capabilities. The matrix below shows minimum coverage requirements:

| Capability | Slow Shift | Medium Shift | Event Shift | Weekend |
|------------|------------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Beverage Mastery | ✓ Required | ✓ Required | ✓✓ Critical | ✓✓ Critical |
| Basic Customer Service | ✓ Required | ✓ Required | ✓ Required | ✓ Required |
| Gaming Knowledge (Basic) | Optional | ✓ Required | ✓ Required | ✓ Required |
| Gaming Knowledge (Deep) | Optional | Optional | ✓✓ Critical | ✓ Required |
| Event Management | N/A | Optional | ✓✓ Critical | As Scheduled |
| Opening/Closing Authority | ✓ Required | ✓ Required | ✓ Required | ✓ Required |

**Staffing Rule:** 
The team on any shift must collectively cover all "Required" and "Critical" capabilities. This means:
- A gaming expert can be paired with a hospitality expert
- A single "Barista Gamer" can cover a slow shift alone
- Event shifts need BOTH beverage capacity AND gaming expertise

---

## 1.3 THE LABOR BUDGET FRAMEWORK

**Year 1 Labor Target:** 50-56% of gross revenue
**Year 2+ Labor Target:** 45-50% of gross revenue

| Position | Monthly Cost | % of Labor Budget |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| General Manager (Salary) | $3,750 | 41% |
| Shift Leads (2-3 PT) | $2,600 | 28% |
| Baristas/Floor Staff (3-5 PT) | $2,840 | 31% |
| **Total Monthly Labor** | **$9,190** | **100%** |

**Note:** Remote support staff are categorized separately as "Professional Services" or "Contractor Expenses," not labor.

## 1.4 STAFF DEMOGRAPHICS: WHO WORKS HERE?

### Age Distribution (Typical)

| Role | Age Range | Median | Notes |
|------|-----------|--------|-------|
| General Manager | 25-45 | 32 | Needs management experience, stability |
| Shift Lead | 21-35 | 26 | Reliable, some experience, can close late |
| Barista/Floor Staff | 18-30 | 22 | Students, early career, flexible |
| Remote Support | Any | N/A | Skills-based, age irrelevant |

### Background Distribution (Typical)

# 2. THE STAFF ARCHETYPE SYSTEM

## 2.1 OVERVIEW

Questpoint uses a **four-tier archetype system** to classify staff capabilities and hiring needs. This is NOT a hierarchy—it's a classification tool for building balanced teams.

| Tier | Archetype Name | Primary Strength | Secondary Strength |
|------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | The Barista Gamer | Both (Balanced) | Leadership potential |
| 2 | The Hospitality Pro | Beverage/Service | Learns gaming basics |
| 3 | The Gamer Convert | Gaming/Culture | Learns beverage skills |
| 4 | Remote Support | Specialized skills | Scalable across locations |

---

## 2.2 TIER 1: THE BARISTA GAMER

### Profile

**Who They Are:**
The unicorn. Someone who genuinely loves both excellent coffee AND gaming culture. They can discuss latte art and Commander deck-building with equal enthusiasm.

**Typical Background:**
- Former game store employee who learned coffee
- Barista who plays MTG/board games as a hobby
- College student who worked at Starbucks AND runs the gaming club
- Career pivoter from hospitality who discovered gaming

**Age Range:** 20-30 (typically)

**Personality Markers:**
- Naturally extroverted or "ambivert"
- Genuine enthusiasm that's visible (not performed)
- Takes pride in quality (both drinks and experiences)
- Problem-solver mentality
- Can read social situations

### Role in the Organization

**Primary Position:** Shift Lead (or GM track)

**Why They're Shift Leads:**
- They can handle ANY situation alone
- They're the "single point of coverage" for slow shifts
- They train and mentor Tier 2 and Tier 3 staff
- They're your emergency coverage when someone calls out

**Scheduling Priority:** 
Every shift should have at least ONE Tier 1 if possible. If not possible, pair Tier 2 + Tier 3 to cover gaps.

### How Many You Need

**Per Location:** 2-4 Tier 1 staff members
- 1 GM (if GM is Tier 1 caliber)
- 2-3 Shift Leads

**Reality Check:** These are hard to find. Budget 2-3 months of active recruiting before opening to identify them.

---

## 2.3 TIER 2: THE HOSPITALITY PRO

### Profile

**Who They Are:**
The "Starbucks Girl" (or guy). Excellent at customer service, beverage preparation, and handling rushes. Limited or no gaming knowledge initially, but **willing to learn the basics**.

**Typical Background:**
- Starbucks, Dutch Bros, Peet's, local coffee shops
- Restaurant servers, bartenders
- Hotel front desk, hospitality industry
- Retail customer service (Apple Store, Nordstrom-level)

**Age Range:** 18-35

**Personality Markers:**
- Service-oriented mindset ("How can I help?")
- Fast learner with new systems
- Comfortable with ambiguity (can figure things out)
- Friendly without being performative
- Doesn't look down on gaming culture (even if unfamiliar)

### Role in the Organization

**Primary Position:** Barista (Beverage-Focused)

**Their Superpower:**
During events (FNM, tournaments), 20-30 people are ordering drinks simultaneously. The Tier 2 staff member handles the rush while the gaming-focused staff runs the tournament. This is CRITICAL. A slow drink line during FNM kills the vibe.

**What They MUST Learn (The "Gaming Basics" Threshold):**
- How to check out/check in rental equipment (collateral system)
- How to explain "buy a drink, stay all day" to new customers
- How to direct customers to the right zone
- What FNM is and when it happens (basic awareness)
- How to say "Let me find someone who can help with that" gracefully

**What They Do NOT Need to Know:**
- MTG rules or card interactions
- Board game strategies
- Gaming meta or culture deep-dives
- How to run a tournament

### The Critical Requirement

**They Must Be Willing to Learn**

The difference between a good Tier 2 hire and a bad one:

| Good Tier 2 | Bad Tier 2 |
|-------------|------------|
| "I don't know much about Magic, but it seems interesting. I'd love to learn the basics." | "I'm just here to make coffee. The gaming stuff isn't really my thing." |
| Watches customers play with curiosity | Looks bored or dismissive during events |
| Asks questions to gaming staff | Avoids the back room entirely |
| Willing to try a board game during downtime | "I don't play games" |

**Interview Red Flag:** If a candidate expresses no interest in learning about the gaming side, they are not a fit—even with excellent barista skills. The hybrid nature of the business requires baseline engagement.

### Scheduling Rules

**Never schedule two Tier 2 staff alone together.**

- Slow shift: Tier 2 can work alone (gaming activity is minimal)
- Medium shift: Tier 2 + Tier 1 or Tier 3
- Event shift: Tier 2 handles drinks, Tier 1/3 handles gaming

### How Many You Need

**Per Location:** 2-3 Tier 2 staff members
- Excellent for morning/afternoon coverage
- Critical for event night drink service

---

## 2.4 TIER 3: THE GAMER CONVERT

### Profile

**Who They Are:**
Your regulars. The customers who love Questpoint so much they want to work there. Deep gaming knowledge, embedded in your community, but may need hospitality training.

**Typical Background:**
- YOUR CUSTOMERS (the guy who's at every FNM)
- Local gaming community members (Discord, Reddit)
- Former game store employees
- Tournament grinders, content creators
- College gaming club members

**Age Range:** 18-35

**Personality Markers:**
- Genuinely passionate about games (it's obvious)
- Already has relationships with your regular customers
- Eager to help new players (not gatekeeping)
- May be introverted but becomes animated about games
- Shows up reliably (as a customer—good sign for employment)

### Role in the Organization

**Primary Position:** Floor Staff (Gaming-Focused)

**Their Superpower:**
They ARE the culture. When a new customer walks in and asks "Is this a good place to learn Magic?", the Tier 3 staff member lights up and gives a genuine, enthusiastic answer. That authenticity is impossible to train.

**What They MUST Learn (The "Hospitality Basics" Threshold):**
- Espresso drink preparation (quality standards)
- Boba tea assembly
- POS system operation
- Food preparation (takoyaki, bao, pretzels)
- Opening and closing procedures
- Customer service scripts

**What They Already Know:**
- Gaming culture and norms
- Rules for major games (MTG, popular board games)
- How to teach games to new players
- Tournament organization and etiquette
- The community (they know the regulars by name)

### The Critical Requirement

**They Must Embrace Hospitality Standards**

The difference between a good Tier 3 hire and a bad one:

| Good Tier 3 | Bad Tier 3 |
|-------------|------------|
| "I know the games inside out—teach me the coffee side!" | "I don't really care about the drinks, I just want to be around games." |
| Treats all customers warmly, even non-gamers | Only engages with "real gamers," dismissive of casuals |
| Willing to make drinks during rushes | "That's not why I'm here" |
| Maintains hygiene and appearance standards | Shows up looking like they just rolled out of bed |
| Can handle non-gaming customer questions | Gets annoyed by "basic" questions |

**Interview Red Flag:** If a candidate seems to want a job where they "just hang out and play games," they misunderstand the role. This is a SERVICE job that happens to be in a gaming environment.

### Scheduling Rules

**Pair Tier 3 with Tier 1 or Tier 2 until fully certified.**

- Tier 3 should NOT work alone until beverage certification is complete
- Ideal pairing: Tier 3 (gaming) + Tier 2 (drinks) covers all bases
- Event shifts: Tier 3 runs the tournament, others support

### How Many You Need

**Per Location:** 2-4 Tier 3 staff members
- Primary source of tournament organizers
- Best for weekend and event coverage

---

## 2.5 SHIFT COMPOSITION EXAMPLES

### Slow Shift (Weekday 10 AM - 2 PM)

**Acceptable:** Tier 2 (gaming activity is minimal during these hours)

### Medium Shift (Weekday 2 PM - 6 PM)

**Acceptable:** Tier 2 + Tier 3 (if Tier 3 is beverage-certified)

## 5.3 RECRUITING FROM YOUR OWN CUSTOMERS

The most effective recruitment pipeline is converting regulars into staff. Here's the process:

### Identification Phase (Ongoing)

**GM and Shift Leads observe regulars for:**
- Positive attitude (friendly to staff and other customers)
- Reliability (shows up consistently, doesn't flake on plans)
- Community contribution (helps new players, makes the space better)
- Appropriate behavior (follows policies, treats space respectfully)

**Track in a simple list:**
- Customer name
- How often they visit
- Notes on potential fit
- Any concerns

### Outreach Phase

**The Informal Conversation:**

*Timing:* During a slow moment, after they've been a regular for at least a month

*Script:*

> "Hey [Name], I wanted to mention something. We're starting to think about hiring, and your name came up. You're here a lot, you're always positive, and you seem to really get what we're doing here. Would you ever be interested in working at Questpoint?"

**If Interested:**

> "Great! I'll send you the application—it's pretty simple. Even though we know you, we still go through the full process with everyone just to be fair. Let's set up a time to chat more formally."

**If Not Interested:**

> "Totally understand. No pressure at all. Just wanted to let you know we think highly of you. If anything changes, door's always open."

### Conversion Phase

**Even known customers go through:**
- Formal application (establishes documentation)
- Full interview (see Section 7)
- Working interview/trial shift
- Normal onboarding

**Why the formal process matters:**
- Fairness (other staff see equitable treatment)
- Documentation (protects against future issues)
- Transition (shifts relationship from customer to employee)

- Offer options ("Our cheapest drink is $3 if you just want something simple")
- Enforce if necessary, but kindly

**Red Flag:**

- Doesn't dismiss or minimize the gaming side
