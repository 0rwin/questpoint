Layout and Design Standards
3.1 The Mullet Layout Philosophy
"Business in the Front, Party in the Back."
The layout creates a psychological transition from the cafe (approachable, normal) to the gaming sanctuary (immersive, community-focused).
Why This Works:
Goal
	How Layout Achieves It
	Approachability
	Front looks like a normal trendy cafe. Non-gamers feel comfortable entering.
	Discovery
	Customers order drinks, then discover gaming area. Creates "wow" moment.
	Traffic Management
	Separates ordering from gaming. Service window prevents cross-traffic.
	Zoning Flexibility
	Front can operate independently during slow hours. Back can close to save labor/utilities.
	Non-Negotiable Layout Rules:
* Cafe is always visible from street (windows, signage)
* Gaming area is not visible from street (maintains approachability)
* Service window connects cafe to Sanctum (no dead ends for staff)
* Clear sightlines for staff to monitor all zones
3.2 Front of House Specifications
Total Area: 500-600 sq ft

Staffing and Training
6.1 Staffing Philosophy - The Party Composition Model
Don't search for unicorns. Build balanced teams.
The Mistake: Seeking "Barista Gamers" who excel at both hospitality AND gaming culture. They exist, but not in numbers sufficient to staff an operation.
The Solution: Every shift must have the collective capability to:
* Make excellent beverages
* Provide warm customer service
* Answer basic gaming questions
* Run scheduled events
* Handle equipment rentals
No single person needs to excel at all of these. The team does.
Staff Archetype System:
Tier
	Archetype
	Primary Strength

Customer Service and Policies
Service and clear policies are what separate Questpoint from typical game stores. We're a hospitality business first.
9.1 Service Philosophy
The Questpoint Standard:
Every customer interaction should feel:
* Welcoming — You belong here
* Effortless — We make it easy
* Genuine — Not scripted, actually human
* Knowledgeable — We know our stuff
Service Mantras:
Mantra
	What It Means
	"Everyone's first time once"
	Never make someone feel dumb for not knowing
	"The drink funds the dream"
	Beverages are sacred — quality matters
	"Third place, not transaction"
	We're building community, not just selling
	"Read the room"
	Adjust energy to match the customer
	9.2 Customer Interactions Standards
The 10-Second Rule:
Every customer receives acknowledgment within 10 seconds of entering.
Situation
	Response
	Staff free, customer enters
	Immediate greeting: "Hey! Welcome to Questpoint!"
	Staff busy, customer enters
	Eye contact + nod + "Be right with you!"
	Customer approaches counter
	Stop task, give full attention
	Greeting Script (New Customers):
"Hey! Welcome to Questpoint. Have you been here before?"
If Yes
	If No
	"Awesome, good to see you! What can I get you?"
	"Welcome! We're a gaming cafe — coffee and boba up front, games in the back. Want me to show you around, or are you just grabbing a drink?"
	The Quick Tour (30 seconds):
"So this is the cafe — order here, pick up there. Through that doorway is the Sanctum — that's our gaming space. Zone A is for card games and board games, couches back there are for consoles, and that counter is the Lab if you need to work or build decks. Grab any drink and you're welcome to hang out as long as you like. Any questions?"
9.3 The “Starbucks Rule”
The Policy:
"Purchase any beverage, stay as long as you like."
Why It Works:
Benefit
	Explanation
	Removes friction
	No cover charge, no membership, no intimidation
	Drives beverage sales
	Primary revenue stream is protected
	Encourages frequency
	$5 drink daily > $10 cover weekly
	Simplifies operations
	No door staff, no tracking, just POS
	Enforcement — The Positive Approach:
Scenario
	Staff Response
	Customer enters, browses, sits down without ordering
	Wait 5-10 min, then approach: "Hey! Can I get you something to drink? We've got coffee, boba, smoothies..."
	Customer declines, says they're "just looking"
	"No problem! Let me know if you have questions. Just so you know, we ask that folks grab a drink if they're going to hang out and use the space."
	Customer still refuses after explanation
	"I hear you. Unfortunately we do need folks to make a purchase to use the gaming areas. Our drip coffee starts at $2.50 if you want something simple!"
	Customer becomes difficult
	Stay calm, get Shift Lead. "Let me grab my manager to help you out."
	Edge Cases:
Scenario
	Policy
	Customer bought drink yesterday, returns today
	New day = new purchase required. "Good to see you again! What can I get you today?"
	Customer bought drink, left, came back same day
	Honor original purchase if within 2-3 hours. Use judgment.
	Parent drops off kids without staying
	Kids must make purchase. No unaccompanied minors under 12.
	Large group, one person orders
	Acceptable for small groups (2-3). For 4+, encourage additional purchases. "Can I grab anyone else a drink?"
	Customer nursing one drink for 6+ hours
	Leave alone unless space is needed. If busy, gently offer: "Can I get you a refill or anything else?"
	9.4 Code of Conduct
Posted visibly near entrance and in gaming zones.

Financial Management
Franchisees don't need MBAs. They need clear systems to track money in, money out, and what's left over.
11.1 Financial Management Philosophy
Three Numbers That Matter:
Metric
	Target
	Why It Matters
	COGS %
	≤35%
	Product cost control
	Labor %
	≤50% (Year 2+)
	Biggest controllable expense
	Net Profit %
	≥5-10% (Year 3+)
	What you actually keep
	The Weekly Rhythm:
Day
	Financial Task
	Monday
	Review last week's P&L
	Wednesday
	Mid-week labor check
	Friday
	End-of-week inventory count
	Sunday
	Submit weekly report to franchisor

11.4 COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) Management
What is COGS?
The direct cost of products sold. For Questpoint: coffee beans, milk, boba pearls, syrups, food ingredients, cups, lids, straws.
COGS Formula:
COGS % = (Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory) ÷ Net Sales × 100
Simplified Weekly Calculation:
COGS % = Total Product Purchases This Week ÷ Net Sales This Week × 100
Target COGS by Category:
Category
	Target COGS
	Acceptable Range
	Coffee/Espresso
	20-25%
	18-28%
	Boba/Tea
	25-30%
	22-33%
	Food
	35-40%
	32-45%
	Blended Store

	If COGS is Too High (>38%):
Possible Cause
	Investigation
	Solution
	Over-portioning
	Watch staff make drinks
	Retrain on recipe specs
	Waste
	Check trash for product
	Improve batch prep timing
	Theft
	Review camera footage
	Address with staff
	Spoilage
	Check expiration dates
	Improve FIFO rotation
	Price increase
	Review invoices
	Negotiate or find new supplier
	Incorrect pricing
	Check POS menu prices
	Update prices if needed
	Inventory Count Schedule:
Item Type
	Frequency
	When
	High-value (coffee beans, milk)
	Weekly
	Friday close
	Moderate (syrups, pearls, cups)
	Bi-weekly
	1st and 15th
	Low-turnover (retail, snacks)
	Monthly
	Last day of month
	

11.5 Labor Cost Management
Labor Cost Formula:
Labor % = Total Labor Cost ÷ Net Sales × 100
Total Labor Cost includes:
* Gross wages (hourly × hours worked)
* Payroll taxes (employer portion ~7.65% FICA)
* Workers' comp insurance allocation
* Any benefits provided
Target Labor % by Year:
Year
	Target
	Notes
	Year 1
	50-56%
	Startup phase, building volume
	Year 2
	45-50%
	Improved efficiency
	Year 3+
	40-45%
	Mature operations

	Week 4
	$5,380
	$2,797
	52%
	55%
	-3% ✓
	If Labor % is Too High:
Cause
	Solution
	Overstaffed on slow days
	Review schedule, cut hours on slow shifts
	Overtime
	Cap at 40 hrs/week, hire additional PT staff
	Low sales
	Focus on marketing, traffic building
	Inefficient operations
	Cross-train staff, improve workflows
	Scheduling Best Practices:
Practice
	Guideline
	Match staff to traffic
	More staff on FNM, fewer on slow mornings
	Avoid overtime
	Track hours mid-week, adjust schedule
	Cross-train
	Every staff member can cover multiple roles
	Split shifts
	Use if needed for coverage without overtime
	On-call shifts
	Only schedule if historically needed
